## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

* Being respectful and inclusive
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing when we make mistakes
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards others

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal attacks
* Harassment of any kind
* Publishing others' private information without permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Enforcement

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards.

reported to the project maintainers at **brett@oneway.co.nz**.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
